# Docker Documentation

## What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications within lightweight, portable containers. These containers encapsulate the application code, runtime environment, system tools, libraries, and settings required to run the application efficiently and consistently across different computing environments, such as development, testing, and production environments.

## Dependencies that Docker Can Manage

1. **Operating System Libraries**: Docker containers can include specific operating system libraries and dependencies required by the application.

2. **Runtime Environments**: Docker can manage different runtime environments, such as Node.js, Python, Java, Ruby, .NET, etc., allowing developers to package applications along with the necessary runtime components.

3. **Frameworks and Libraries**: Docker can handle dependencies on frameworks and libraries that applications rely on to function correctly.

4. **Database Systems**: Docker can manage database systems such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, etc., enabling developers to package and run databases alongside their applications.

5. **Networking Configuration**: Docker manages networking configurations for containers, allowing them to communicate with each other and external services.

6. **Storage Volumes**: Docker can manage storage volumes and mount points required by applications to store and access persistent data.

7. **Third-Party Services and APIs**: Docker containers can interact with external services and APIs required by applications, such as authentication services, payment gateways, messaging queues, etc.

# Docker vs Git

## Docker

- **Purpose**: Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
- **Functionality**: It packages applications and dependencies into containers for consistent deployment across different environments.
- **Benefits**: Ensures application behavior consistency and simplifies deployment processes.

## Git

- **Purpose**: Git is a version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.
- **Functionality**: It enables collaboration among multiple developers by managing changes to source code over time.
- **Benefits**: Facilitates tracking changes, merging code from different contributors, and reverting to previous versions if needed.

In Summary, Docker focuses on application packaging and deployment, while Git handles version control and collaboration on source code.

# This Project : Simple Node/Express API with Docker

This project is a simple Node.js/Express API aimed at learning Docker.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**:  =>   "git clone https://github.com/Manas0410/Docker_Docs.git" 
2. **Install Dependencies**:  =>   "npm install"
3. **Start the Server**:      =>   "npm run start"
   
# how to build and and run docker image locally
Terminal command 
1 command to create docker image 
docker build -t basic-app3:v2 . 

2 command to run docker image 

# Docker Image Management

This repository contains instructions for managing Docker images on Docker Hub.

## Steps

1. **Create Repository in Docker Hub**: 
   - Go to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and sign in or sign up.
   - Create a new repository by clicking on the "Create Repository" button.
   - Follow the prompts to set up your repository.

2. **Build and Push Docker Image**:
   - Log in to Docker Hub using the following command:
     ```
     docker login
     ```
   - Build the Docker image using the following command:
     ```
     docker build -t yourusername/imagename .
     ```
   - Push the Docker image to Docker Hub using the following command:
     ```
     docker push yourusername/imagename
     ```

3. **Pull Image from Docker Hub**:
   - To pull the image from Docker Hub, use the following command:
     ```
     docker pull yourusername/imagename
     ```

## Usage
- Modify the commands above as needed for your specific Docker image and repository names.
- Ensure you have Docker installed and configured on your system before running the commands.
