# Docker Documentation

## What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications within lightweight, portable containers. These containers encapsulate the application code, runtime environment, system tools, libraries, and settings required to run the application efficiently and consistently across different computing environments, such as development, testing, and production environments.

## Dependencies that Docker Can Manage

1. **Operating System Libraries**: Docker containers can include specific operating system libraries and dependencies required by the application.

2. **Runtime Environments**: Docker can manage different runtime environments, such as Node.js, Python, Java, Ruby, .NET, etc., allowing developers to package applications along with the necessary runtime components.

3. **Frameworks and Libraries**: Docker can handle dependencies on frameworks and libraries that applications rely on to function correctly.

4. **Database Systems**: Docker can manage database systems such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, etc., enabling developers to package and run databases alongside their applications.

5. **Networking Configuration**: Docker manages networking configurations for containers, allowing them to communicate with each other and external services.

6. **Storage Volumes**: Docker can manage storage volumes and mount points required by applications to store and access persistent data.

7. **Third-Party Services and APIs**: Docker containers can interact with external services and APIs required by applications, such as authentication services, payment gateways, messaging queues, etc.

# Docker vs Git

## Docker

- **Purpose**: Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
- **Functionality**: It packages applications and dependencies into containers for consistent deployment across different environments.
- **Benefits**: Ensures application behavior consistency and simplifies deployment processes.

## Git

- **Purpose**: Git is a version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.
- **Functionality**: It enables collaboration among multiple developers by managing changes to source code over time.
- **Benefits**: Facilitates tracking changes, merging code from different contributors, and reverting to previous versions if needed.

In Summary, Docker focuses on application packaging and deployment, while Git handles version control and collaboration on source code.
